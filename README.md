# Hello World! by Polkadot

Gitcoin has integrated Polkadot and Kusama tokens (DOT and KSM) into its tech stack, making them one of the first full integrations outside of the Ethereum ecosystem.

To celebrate the integration on Gitcoin, we are organising Hello World! by Polkadot, a series of challenges to bring you on a journey of Polkadot development discovery.
